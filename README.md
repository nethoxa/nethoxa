Go check my [website](https://nethoxa.github.io/) to see my work. These are my stats since I switched from Windows kernel hacking to crypto in July 2023:

| C4 leaderboard 2023 | C4 leaderboard all time | Immunefi payed reports | Cumulative earnings |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------:|
|      220/1385       |        395/1873         |           2            |      $7,557.54      |

I raised a 500K pre-seed round for an aerospace startup before that, too. It's a long story, keep going.
