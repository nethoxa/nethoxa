Some achievements I have:

- `500K` pre-seed round at age 19 for an aerospace startup (long story)
- 🏅 Top 4 in the Basin contest (July 2023)
- 🏅 Top 5 in the zkSync Era contest (the 1.1M one)
- 🏅 Top 6 in the DeGate Boost (December 2023)
- 🥉 Top 3 in the Autonolas contest (December 2023)
- 🥉 Top 3 in the Canto contest (January 2024)
- 🏅 Top 25 in the Blast contest (February 2024)
- 🏅 Top 5 in the Doubler contest (March 2024)
- 🏅 Top 5 in the Gondi contest (April 2024)

After that, I led `>14` audits for projects ranging from Geth forks, the zkVM of one of the biggest L2s (with severe bugs found after tons of audits), Cosmos chains and many more, with a TVL secured of `>1.1B`. Overall, I found `18 criticals`, `24 highs` and `32 mediums` **JUST** in 2024.

Oh, and `2 criticals` in one of the leading ZK L2 as well as a `generic critical` in most Cosmos chains.
